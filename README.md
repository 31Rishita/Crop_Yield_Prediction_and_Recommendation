# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction and Next Crop Recommendation using BiLSTM

## 📘 Overview
This project introduces a **Deep Learning–based Intelligent System** for **crop yield prediction** and **next crop recommendation** using a **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)** model.  
It helps farmers make **data-driven**, **sustainable**, and **profitable** agricultural decisions.

## 🔍 Key Features
- Predicts **crop yield** based on soil and environmental parameters (N, P, K, rainfall, humidity, temperature).  
- Recommends the **most suitable next crop** for given soil and weather conditions.  
- Uses **BiLSTM** to capture both past and future time dependencies for better prediction accuracy.

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Collect and preprocess agricultural data.  
2. Train the BiLSTM model on soil and climate features.  
3. Predict yield and recommend the next best crop.  

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## 🌱 Outcome
An **AI-powered system** that improves **crop productivity**, enhances **sustainability**, and reduces **economic risks** for farmers.
